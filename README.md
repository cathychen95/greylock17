# Civil

Civil is a live conversation transcriber and note-taker. It finds structure in the argument or discussion you are having and visualizes it real-time for you in a conversation tree, identifying claims, evidence, and rebuttals.

## Problem

Arguments and discussion are difficult:
- it's hard to keep track of what’s been said and what’s been refuted
- the louder you are, the more you control the argument - unfair and biased
- dialogue is consumed linearly when they are better understood as nested back and forths

Being able to have structured, constructive conversations with people who disagree is key to bridging the ideological/cultural divide in the country and around the world.
